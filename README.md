### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Sinha A.

Hello! Iâ€™m Sinha, an aspiring programmer and cybersecurity specialist with a passion for technology and a commitment to learning. Currently, I am honing my programming skills in languages such as C, C++, Python, My SQL, Kali Linux ,Metasploit, while exploring the fascinating world of cybersecurity.

As a beginner, I am eager to apply my knowledge and grow in areas like ethical hacking, network security, and risk assessment. I believe that a solid foundation in programming is essential for understanding and addressing cybersecurity challenges, and I am dedicated to merging these two fields effectively.

I thrive on problem-solving and enjoy tackling new challenges that help me enhance my technical abilities. I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate, learn from experienced professionals, and contribute to projects that make a difference.

Letâ€™s connect and explore how we can work together to create secure and innovative solutions!

Skills: C / C++/ Python / My SQL / Kali Linux

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Programming at Phitron and I completed my Cyber Security Course at Creative IT Institute.
